Beginning (Akshay)

Once upon a time, there was a young Computer Science Student named Akshay. He was always a mischevous person, and one day Akshay let his nature get the best of him. 
He stole gold from the gods, and then was caught because the gold was marked and had a dye pack. The gods gave him two choices, either rot in hell for eternity, or go on the long 
and perilous quest where he would have to slay a dangerous monster, the Hashtable, a quest many students before him have failed. Knowing he couldn't do it alone, he asked his 
friends to come with him, and so Team LE was formed, with the goal of slaying this horrible beast. A wise old man told Akshay that the Hashtable could be found prowling around the 
depths of the mythical land known as the UW-Madison Computer Science lab, and that it was not to be trifled with. Well-rested and ready, with a team of warriors behind him, Akshay 
set sail for this mythical land, looking to regain his honor, and make up for his past deeds.

A pretty dope story so mind blowing that Chenyu did not know how to respond. As another hacker, it is our destiny to destroy this monster because if we do not, all is lost. Given my cunning abilities and my questionable history, I was recruited by Team Le to help destroy this monstrous virus.
